# interferometryEMI

I am Hauyu Baobab Liu, an associate professor at the Department of Physics of National Sun Yat-sen University, More details about me can be found [here](https://baobabyoo.github.io/),
Here is my EMI lecture of radio interferometry at National Sun Yat-sen University (NSYSU)
To my understanding, I have sold the material I am sharing to the Ministry of Education (i.e., they own the license).
I have a quite poor understanding about such legal issues, unfortunately.
But I know I can feel free to share these material on my webpage; you can also watch and share them for free.
If you would like to modify or directly re-use the material, you may need to consult them, although I also do not know how.
Please feel free to contact me regarding this. I can help you consult them. 

This is a preliminary version of the first half of the material.
There may be something wrong.
If you see that, it would be very much appreciated if you would like me know.
I will correct it.
